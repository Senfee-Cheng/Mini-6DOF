# Mini-6DOF
Desktop size version of my Open 6DOF Platform. This is an expansion on my initial learning that I did to get up to speed for the big version.  I wanted to enabled BLE use so I can control the little platform from my phone,.. or other BLE device.

This uses a fork of the Open 6dof Code, I am working on an android app that will also control the device.
